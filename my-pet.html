    <h1>My pet</h1>
    <p>My pet is a cat: Bella. She is my best friend</p>
    <h2>How I met Bella</h2>
    <p>Bella was my aunts pet and I happened to be so close to my aunt. So, I could visit my aunt every often. Bella and I got fond of each other such that she would cling on me whenever it was time for me to leave.</p>
    <p>Aunty loved Bella so much and she always wanted happiness for her. She had realized that Bella always wanted to be around me. She decided to give Bella to me.</p>
    <p>It's been two years now and we are still friends with Bella. Here are some of the things we do together:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We play together</li>
      <li>We jog together</li>
      <li>And sometimes we even sleep together</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bella is the best thing that ever happened to me. Thank you aunt for gifting me with her.</p>
